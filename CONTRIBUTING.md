# What to contribute?
## FIXME
In some files, I left a "FIXME" note. This means that there is some sort of unresolved issue. In almost all cases, I described the issue. If you know a fix to this, you are welcome to contribute it!

# Found a bug?
... or bad practice or deprecated code? Despite my best effort, I cannot always guarantee that the code is bug free and 100% up to date. I'm always very thankful for help!

# Adding tutorials
You're also more than welcome to add your own tutorials here.

# I feel creative!
In case you have any other idea that you think would fit well into this repo, just go for it. Initiative is highly appreciated!
